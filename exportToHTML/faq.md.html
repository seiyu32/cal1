<span class="s2">### </span><span class="s1">Why is the Google Analytics code at the bottom? Google recommends it be placed in the </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s1">&lt;head&gt;</span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s1">The main advantage of placing it in the </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s1">&lt;head&gt;</span><span class="s3">` </span><span class="s1">is that you will track the</span>
<span class="s1">user's </span><span class="s3">`</span><span class="s1">pageview</span><span class="s3">` </span><span class="s1">even if they leave the page before it has been fully loaded.</span>

<span class="s1">Here's a handy quote from </span><span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">Mathias Bynens</span><span class="s0">](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/async-analytics-snippet#comment-50) </span><span class="s1">about our placement choice.</span>
<span class="s2">&gt;</span><span class="s1">I should point out that it’s Google — not me — recommending to place this</span>
<span class="s1">script before all other scripts in the document. The only real advantage is to</span>
<span class="s1">catch a pageView call if your page fails to load completely </span><span class="s0">(</span><span class="s1">for example, if</span>
<span class="s1">the user aborts loading, or quickly closes the page, etc.</span><span class="s0">)</span><span class="s1">. Personally, I</span>
<span class="s1">wouldn’t count that as a page view, so I actually prefer to place this script</span>
<span class="s1">at the bottom, after all other scripts. This keeps all the scripts together and</span>
<span class="s1">reinforces that scripts at the bottom are the right move. </span><span class="s0">(</span><span class="s1">Usually I</span>
<span class="s1">concatenate and minify all my scripts into one .js file — the GA snippet being</span>
<span class="s1">the suffix.</span><span class="s0">)</span>

<span class="s2">### </span><span class="s1">Do I need to upgrade my site each time a new version of HTML5 Boilerplate is released?</span>

<span class="s1">No, just as you don't normally replace the foundation of a house once it</span>
<span class="s1">was built. However, there is nothing stopping you from trying to work in the</span>
<span class="s1">latest changes, but you'll have to assess the costs/benefits of doing so.</span>

<span class="s2">### </span><span class="s1">Where can I get help with support questions?</span>

<span class="s1">Please ask for help on</span>
<span class="s0">[</span><span class="s1">StackOverflow</span><span class="s0">](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html5boilerplate)</span><span class="s1">.</span>
